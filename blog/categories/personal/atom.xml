    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Happy New Year!</p>

<p>A New Year, a new blog. I've decided to move my personal blog from <a href="http://posterous.com/">Posterous</a> to <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>. I like the simplicity of Octopress and it's really easy to setup and deploy. Aside from that, using <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> make it very handy writing a blog.</p>

<p>Over time, I'll try to maintain this site and evolve with things that I have already done, things that I have to share and accumulate more experiences in the future.</p>

<p>Happy Coding! :)</p>

<h4>[UPDATE] 02/17/2013</h4>

<p>Posterous is turning off on April 30, 2013. No wonder.<br/>
For those who haven't moved from Posterous yet, it's time to back-up your data.<br/>
See their blog <a href="http://blog.posterous.com/thanks-from-posterous">here</a>.</p>

I'll take time to update this regularly amidst of my busy time. lol. :)</p>

<p>It's been a while also that I've started into iPhone development (iPhone OS 3.0) and still have a lot to learn and hope I could post much tutorial as I've walked through.</p>

<p>So, follow me in my roller-coaster ride! :)</p>
