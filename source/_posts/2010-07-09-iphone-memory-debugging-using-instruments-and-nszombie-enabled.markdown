When your iPhone app crashes caused by "BAD ACCESS", it's really painful to trace the code fault. It feels good Instruments have support for enabling the NSZombie detection.   
  
Thanks to markj for writing this good [guide](http://www.markj.net/iphone-memory-debug-nszombie/)â€¦definitely, helped me out.

Cheers!
