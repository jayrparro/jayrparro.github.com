I've been doing Ruby on Rails recently and setting its configuration on Mac OSX Mountain Lion with Xcode 4.6 installed is bit of a pain.  

If you want to update to the latest stable version of Ruby, which is v1.9.3 as of now, you'd better install first - [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/) and [Ruby Version Manager (RVM)](https://rvm.io/).  
  
This [tutorial](http://www.moncefbelyamani.com/how-to-install-xcode-homebrew-git-rvm-ruby-on-mac/) from Moncef Belyamani, I've found it very useful.   
  
A note to self.
