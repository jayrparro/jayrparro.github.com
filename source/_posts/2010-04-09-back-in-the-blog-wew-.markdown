It's been a long time since I've updated this blog of mine.    
I'll take time to update this regularly amidst of my busy time. lol. :)  
  
It's been a while also that I've started into iPhone development (iPhone OS 3.0) and still have a lot to learn and hope I could post much tutorial as I've walked through.  
  
So, follow me in my roller-coaster ride! :)
