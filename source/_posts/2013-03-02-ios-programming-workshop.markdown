Spending my whole-day weekend volunteering as a Coach/Trainer for the iOS Programming Workshop organized by Elisha Tan of [Learnemy](https://secure.learnemy.com/) and our group, [iOSDevScout](http://iosdevscout.com/), that's being held in [Plug-In@Blk71](http://www2.blk71.com/). The main speaker is [Subhransu Behera](https://twitter.com/subhransu).
  
I'm surprise with the number of people of different ages & races, that show up in the workshop eager to learn iOS Development. Tech scene in Singapore is so vibrant! :-)

Here's the scene of the iOS Programming workshop:
