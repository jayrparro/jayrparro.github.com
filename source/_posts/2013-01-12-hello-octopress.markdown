Happy New Year!  

A New Year, a new blog. I've decided to move my personal blog from Posterous to Octopress. I like the simplicity of Octopress and it's really easy to setup and deploy. Aside from that, using [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) make it very handy writing a blog.
  
Over time, I'll try to maintain this site and evolve with things that I have already done, things that I have to share and accumulate more experiences in the future.  
  
Happy Coding! :)
