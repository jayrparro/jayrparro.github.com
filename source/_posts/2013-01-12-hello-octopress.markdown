Happy New Year!  

A New Year, a new blog. I've decided to move my personal blog from [Posterous](http://posterous.com/) to [Octopress](http://octopress.org/). I like the simplicity of Octopress and it's really easy to setup and deploy. Aside from that, using [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) make it very handy writing a blog.
  
Over time, I'll try to maintain this site and evolve with things that I have already done, things that I have to share and accumulate more experiences in the future.  
  
Happy Coding! :)

####[UPDATE] 02/17/2013    
Posterous is turning off on April 30, 2013. No wonder.  
For those who haven't moved from Posterous yet, it's time to back-up your data.  
See their blog [here](http://blog.posterous.com/thanks-from-posterous).
